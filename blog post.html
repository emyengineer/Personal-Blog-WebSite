					Design systems force designers to systematize their work, to think in components.
					Front end developers are already doing this. They’ve been doing this.
					When design teams create design systems,
					suddenly they start thinking like their developer teammates and speaking the same language.

					<h2>Sub Heading</h2>
					<p>
						So what? Well, as you can imagine when teammates start speaking the same language and solving problems together,
						 a lot more work gets done. And faster!
					</p>
					<h3>Sub Heading</h3>
					<p>
						When a technology matures, design moves to the foreground because the underlying machinery has been commoditized.
					</p>
					<h3>Are you sure it’s called a “design system”</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>Pattern library</li>
						<li>Modular design</li>
						<li>Component design</li>
						<li>Design language</li>
						<li>User interface library</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
					Sure, there are nuances to all of these, but they’re basically doing the same thing:
					 creating a series of design components for you and your team to reuse.
					 Sometimes, you’ll even find elements of a design system in a style or brand guide.
